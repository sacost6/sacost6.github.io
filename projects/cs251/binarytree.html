    <h3>Requirements Summary</h3>
    <p> For this program, we were required to implement a binary search tree which had the requirements as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Maintain an asymptotic runtime for insertions</li>
      <li>Maintain an O(H) runtime for the functions where H is the height of the BST</li>
      <li>Write a function to place all values of the BST in a vector</li>
      <li>Write a function get_ith which returns the value at the specified place</li>
      <li>Write a function which returned the values greater than or equal to the parameter</li>
      <li>Write a function which returned the values that are less than or equal to the parameter</li>
      <li>Write a function which returned the values betweeen a specified range</li>
      <li>Assure the height of the binary search tree was log<sub>2</sub>(N) where N is the total number of nodes</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

    <h3>Solution</h3>
    <p>In order to implement the following requirements, my solutions were as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>In order to keep the runtime asymptotic when rebalancing the BST, I made sure to only rebalance it when <br> one of the subtrees did not meet the
           required height because it was a costly function in terms of runtime</li>
      <li>In order to keep a O(H) runtime on the functions that were written, an integer variable was added to the node <br> data structure which
          kept track of the number of children belonging to each node. This change helped to <br> avoid traversing every individual node when trying to count nodes based on a requirement. </li>
      <li>Created a vector with BST values by recursively went through all nodes and children of nodes, then added <br> them to vector upon return</li>
      <li>Able to retrieve the value at the specified position this by using the property of BSTs where all nodes are in <br> order and the leftmost <br> one is the smallest value, from there
          I used a counter to traverse through</li>
      <li>Able to retrieve values greater than or equal to the parameter by traversing the BST recursively until the value <br> is found, or a value greater than the specified value is found, <br> then
          use the counter value in the node's data structure to return the total number of values that are greater <br> than or equal to the parameter</li>
      <li>Same approach as the point above, only with values less than or equal to the parameter</li>
      <li>Same approact as the greater than or equal to function, only with a range specified by the parameters</li>
      <li>Used a rebalancing function to check if there is an imbalance of the number of children in the parent everytime <br> a new node is deleted or added     to the BST</li>
    </ul>
