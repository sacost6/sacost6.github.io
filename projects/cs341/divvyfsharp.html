      <h3>Project Background</h3>
      <p>You’ve probably seen the blue bikes that are part of
      Divvy bike sharing system here in Chicago. The Divvy
      system is a commuting service where users pay a yearly fee
      ($75?) to use the bikes for free as long as rides are less than 30
        minutes in duration. Longer rides incur a surcharge. It’s a
        very popular system, with stations throughout the city and
        some suburbs.
        Interestingly, the Divvy folks also make their ride data
        available as part of Chicago’s open data <a href = "https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Divvy-Trips-Dashboard/u94x-unre">portal</a>; Divvy’s data is available <a href="https://www.divvybikes.com/data">here</a>.
        The goal in this assignment is to input ride data for a period of time, and perform some analysis of the
        data: # of bikes, which stations are in use the most often, the average ride duration, etc. </p>
        <h3>Project Summary</h3>
        <p> This program was not only my first full F# program written, but my first functional program working with data sets. The goal in this assignment is to input ride data for a period of time, and perform some analysis of the
        data: # of bikes, which stations are in use the most often, the average ride duration, etc.  </p>
      <div class="container-fluid bg-1 text-left">
        <h3>Requirements:</h3>
        <p> No imperative programming. In particular, this means no mutable variables, no loops, and no data
        structures other than F# lists. Use recursion and higher-order approaches only; you must also work with the
        input format as given, i.e. a list of lists. </p>
